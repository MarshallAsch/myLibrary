My own library for code that I would use often such as a data structure for a dynamic array for any data type.

in library mystruct

included my implementation of a boolean (bool) type with TRUE and FALSE 
as well as a macro function TOGGLE() to swap between true and false.

uses a typedef of type int for the boolean

the myinput.c file is to get the \n terminated input from the user or from a file (or will get an integer from the file or standard input.

mastering can search, sort  append and find the occurrences of character in a string.
